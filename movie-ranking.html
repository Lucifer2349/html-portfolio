<h1> The best movies to watch according to Yash</h1>

<h2>my top 3 movies of all time :</h2>
<hr />
<h3>INCEPTION</h3>
<P>The idea of the movie just amazes me. The way it is.</P>
<h3>SPIDERMAN ACROSS THE SPIDER VERSE AND INTO THE SPIDER VERSE </h3>
<P>Both the movies have outdone themselves. <br />
   The animation, the songs, the characters and the plot.<br/>
    Everything's just perfect. <br/></P>
<h3>DR. STRANGE</h3>
<P>The story is really nice with all the ancient history and the time stone .</P>
